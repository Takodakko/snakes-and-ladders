# Ships and Islands

## Set up steps

-This is a variation on Snakes and Ladders.

-Start by choosing a username, logging in to a previously created username, or logging in as a guest.

-Choose your player piece, and how many tiles you want on the board.

## Game Rules

-Your starting stamina is the number of tiles on the board - 1. Your points start at 0. 

-However, you can trade stamina for points (1 for 1) during setup to start with more points.

-Moving forward subtracts stamina based on the numebr of tiles moved. Exploring an island uses 1 stamina.

-Resting recovers stamina by half the amount on the die, rounded down.

-Each turn you take (either exploring or resting) subtracts 1 point.

-When you explore an island, you may gain points, but you may also lose points. (Sometimes nothing happens at all!)

-If you run out of stamina before arriving at the final tile, you lose.

-If you arrive at the final tile, you get to keep your score.
